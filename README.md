# Assessment Website Project

This repository contains my submission for the assessment project, where I was tasked with creating a responsive website using HTML5, implementing various features, and ensuring compatibility with modern browsers. Below are the details of the project and the steps I've taken to fulfill the requirements.

## Project Requirements

- Create a website using HTML5 tags only.
- Make the webpage responsive to various screen sizes.
- Implement lazy loading for images to optimize page loading.
- Utilize Owl Carousel for sliders to showcase content.
- Ensure proper functionality on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge).
- Incorporate dummy images and content as needed for demonstration.
- Build a mobile-responsive menu using pure JavaScript or jQuery.
- Include a page loader that covers the entire screen and fades after loading.

## Implementation

1. **HTML5 Structure**: I've structured the website using appropriate HTML5 semantic tags to ensure proper organization of content.

2. **Responsiveness**: The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Media queries have been used to adjust the layout and styles accordingly.

3. **Lazy Loading**: Images on the webpage are set to load lazily, enhancing the initial page load time and overall user experience.

4. **Owl Carousel**: To enhance the visual appeal of the website, I've integrated the Owl Carousel plugin for creating dynamic image sliders.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: The webpage has been thoroughly tested and optimized to work seamlessly across modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Edge.

6. **Dummy Content**: Placeholder images and content have been used to simulate a real-world scenario and showcase the design layout.

7. **Mobile Menu**: I've implemented a mobile-responsive menu using [JavaScript/jQuery], ensuring smooth navigation on smaller screens.

8. **Page Loader**: A page loader has been added that covers the entire screen upon initial loading and fades away once the page content is fully loaded.
9. 
10. **Scroll reveal**: A Scroll reveal  has been added for a smooth and animated scroll behavior.
